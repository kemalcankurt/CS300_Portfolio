# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
## I worked on both implementing data structures and analyzing the cost for them. Further, I did work on implementing file opening and reading, interacting with users by taking input and rendering outputs based on made selections.
 
# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
## My initial approach to any problem is understanding and analyzing the situation. In this scenario, I was given different requirements for each problem. Input taking and handling was one of them, which was quite interesting to do using C++. Understanding data structures is particularly important when implementing a solution for a given problem. The reason is that while a data structure performs very well for accessing data, it may not be as good as while inserting. Thus, understanding all data structures and the problem is crucial to implementing the most optimal solution.
# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
## My biggest challenge was development tools. Although SNHU gives a lab for me to build my projects, it was a complex experience to launch lab and Visual Studio as the IDE wanted me to put my credentials every time. Also, some key combinations were not working as I am used to. However, I could finally set up my own environment on my Mac using Visual Studio Code.
# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
## I gained a massive amount of knowledge about data structures. This course helped me change my perspective toward data structures by implementing and analyzing them for various scenarios.
# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
## This course and my instructor's feedback helped me to use comments more effectively to make my code more readable and understandable. Further, the course also helped me improve my OOP abilities, as how we write C++ codes is particularly useful for this purpose. For example, creating header files for definitions and class files where private and public properties are defined separately also applies to methods.
